hint 1 : you NEED to deep dive into mt19337's implementation, e.g. https://github.com/yinengy/Mersenne-Twister-in-Python/blob/master/MT19937.py

remember that the individual outputs doesn't have to be equal, just the xor sum in the end

also note how the states in mt19337 work, does the ordering of the state matter much? what happens if you mess with particular bits?

hint 2 :my solver works exactly 50% of the time (per connection)

maybe you can't calculate everything, just look at how the bits change

hint 3: observe what happens if you shift the states

[s0, s1, ..., s622, s623]

vs

[s1, s2, ..., s623, junk]

do all the outputs change? maybe only some of them are important? look at how the mt19337 implementation processes this

now how would you solve this if there was no timeout?

finally, observe what happens when you change each bit, maybe you can just observe each bit separately
